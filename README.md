## Ramon Laravel Version 10
use this to install the project dependencies and packages: `composer install --ignore-platform-req=ext-gd --ignore-platform-req=ext-zip`
this project can't run `php artisan serve` commands because that project architecture was already designed to run inside a third-party local server applications. ex:'xampp','ammps'.
Any Other `artisan commands` run perfectly inside the `core folder`
